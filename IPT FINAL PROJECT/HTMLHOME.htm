                    possibly make you understand me more such as what are the things that I like and hate, things that make me happy,
                    what or who is my motivation. Now, before you jump into it I want to say thankyou for visiting me and I hope that
                    you enjoy browsing!

                    In  this section, you will get to know my family. Our family might be small but they are my everything.
                    They are my motivation in studying that's why no matter how hard a school activity or exam  is I still try to get
                    a good output from it so I can graduate as soon possible.
