                Hello! Welcome to my personal website. I'm Ivan Paul C. Barra. I'm currently 20 years old and
                I am proud to say that my nationality is Filipino. So, let me tell you more about myself by
                starting at the things that I like, I choose BSIT because I like how our technology continue to
                grow because of that I choose to be part of it by studying this course and wishing to contribute
                something no matter how small it is. For the things that I personally dislike is those people
                who spread toxicity on social media, I mean what benefit are they getting from doing that. It's
                annoying when some people do that and I wish someday  they stop all of it. In my motivation in
                life is of course my family, the reason is it's hard to see my mother struggle from every day expenses
                so while I'm still studying I will try to provide a good grades and hopefully finish this course without
                hindrances.
                Anyway, that is all the information I can share with you. As you have read I'm just a regular person
                nothing special but trying to be better. So again, Thankyou so much for visiting and I hope that you
                like my design and content!
            </p>
