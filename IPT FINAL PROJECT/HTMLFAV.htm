                <h1 class="wtitle"> W3SCHOOLS</h1>
                The w3schools is one of my favorite website not only because of the wide variety of languages it offer
                to teach but also the way it explains every code is very clear. Since the day I started in college, w3schools
                is the website that I usually used to do certain school activities. This website might still be the one that
                I will used in the future semester because I can easily  read some languages in advance that I can probably use.
                If the day that comes that I became a professional computer programmer I want to thank personally the company who
                created the w3schools. Further, I will work hard so that I can masterize every programming languages that this
                website offer.

                <h1 class="anime"> 9ANIME</h1>
                You might already heard the phrase "I love anime" multiple, I mean who can blame them right? Anime offers like everything:
                actions, drama, motivation, comedy, and many more. There's a lot of website that has a free anime but the I just choose
                9 anime because this is the usual site that I use to watch multiple animes. It can update the viewers on when will the
                next episode of the certain anime and it also update fast. Although, I do not recommend this website because of the multiple
                pop up ads.

                <h1 class="twitch_title"> TWITCH</h1>
                In terms of socializing with multiple gaming communities, I always go to Twitch because some of my favorite streamers is always
                streaming in Twitch. There are multiple streaming platforms that some streamers can use but I do not know why they choose the Twitch,
                so because of that me as an active viewers always use twitch as well. In twitch, I can freely choose what specific games that I want
                to watch. Some big streamers is also very supportive to those people who just started streaming I mean it's very nice to know how
                wholesome the community is.

                <h1 class="youtube_title"> YOUTUBE </h1>
                Youtube is one of the website that offers educational videos, jobs, asmr, but mostly entertainment videos. I personally love to watch
                Filipino content creators who has a content of comedy and motivational videos such as CONG TV, Mavs Phenomenal Basketball, Geo Ong and
                many more. It is very sad and annoying as well that some creators spread toxicity on the platform that lead to nothing but unnecessary
                conflicts. But still, Youtube is still one of the website to use to entertain.

                Since I'm still just a student, I still cannot afford to montly avail Netflix, HBO, Disney Channel, Hulu, and other movie streaming services.
                So, I admit that I often use some websites that allow me to watch movies or TV-shows for free. In this website, I can watch any movies and
                tv-shows that I want for free and also has a feature to choose subtitles and resolutions. The website is user friendly and does not required
                to have fast internet because you can choose server that suits the capabilities of your internet. I just want you to know that I'm aware that
                this kind of websites is illegal and will promise that will stop using this when I already have a decent job.
