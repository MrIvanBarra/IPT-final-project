            <p>
                Hello! I'm Ivan, I am a BSIT student at Colegio De Montalban. The concept that I
                think will work in this project is reflecting on the profession that I want to pursue which
                is in game industry. I present all the things that I learned and love along my journey in this world
                because this is my way on showing my creativity and passion to what I'm doing. And to make
                all things clear all the things that you'll see in this website is for educational purposes only
                and some of the object that I used in this website are not mine such as the images and logo but
                the content of the whole site is my idea. I will put all the credits to the images that I used
                in developing this website in the credits section. Thank you for visiting and I hope that I inspire
                some people to never be afraid to show what they really are and the things that they truly love.
