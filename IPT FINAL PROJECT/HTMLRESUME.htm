                        The player came from a poor family and dedicate his life to develop and obtain more skills. He
                        encounter difficulties along the way but improve more as he fight monsters regularly. Aside from monsters,
                        it is fortunate that he also found friends to travel with and enjoy his journey more. Until now he did not
                        stop training and keep getting better in his journey. He is not perfect and will probably not gonna be
                        the best player but promised to himself that he will try to be better than before.
